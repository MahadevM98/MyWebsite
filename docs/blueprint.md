- Headline font: 'Playfair', serif, used for titles and headers, and paired with 'PT Sans' in the body to provide a professional appearance with good legibility.
- Use a set of clean, modern icons that are consistent in style. Icons should be used sparingly and only when they enhance understanding or navigation.

- Incorporate subtle animations for interactive elements. Animations should be smooth, brief, and contribute to the overall user experience without being distracting.
